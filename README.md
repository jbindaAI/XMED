## Overview

Welcome to the XMED Project repository! This project aims to leverage state-of-the-art Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) using Vision Transformers (ViT) (specifically DINO) in the medical domain. The end goal is to integrate these models with Explainable AI (XAI) methods and deploy the resulting application as a web service on IBM Cloud.

## Introduction

The XMED Project is focused on developing advanced machine learning models for medical imaging. By utilizing SSL with ViT models, we aim to improve the performance and accuracy of medical image analysis. Additionally, integrating XAI methods will provide transparency and interpretability to the model's predictions, making it more reliable for clinical use.

## Features

- **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)**: Implementing DINO-based ViT models for effective learning from unlabelled medical images.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Integrating XAI techniques to ensure model interpretability and transparency.
- **Web Application**: Deploying the model as an accessible web application on IBM Cloud.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and provide fast, reliable predictions.
